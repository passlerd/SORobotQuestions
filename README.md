For questions with multiple answers and/or multiple comments, the question will appear in multiple rows in the data set with a different answer in the answer columns for each entry of that question.
Each combination of question and answer is again repeated for each comment. For example, if a question has three answers, and two comments, there will be six rows in the data set with the same question ID and associated question data, three rows with the first
comment and different data associated with each answer in each row, and three rows with the second comment and the data associated with answers being different in each row.
